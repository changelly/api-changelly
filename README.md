Instant exchange API
=====================================

Changelly API methods are used to empower your service with Changelly exchange features.

Changelly API v2 is a faster, safer and more flexible version of our API.
It remains backward compatible with the previous version.
For more information about the API methods and usage, see our [API documentation](https://docs.changelly.com/).

[Changelly API v1](https://docs.changelly.com/v1/) has been deprecated. 
We are planning to sunset it soon.
If you are currently using API v1, we strongly recommend that you start planning your migration from API v1 to API v2.
To ensure that your applications continue to function seamlessly without interruption,
use the [migration guidelines](https://docs.changelly.com/#tag/Migration-from-Exchange-API-v1).
